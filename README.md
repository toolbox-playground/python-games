# python-games

Collection of small Pygame projects for learning and exercises.

First entry: `ninja-game` (cloned from https://github.com/tombackert/ninja-game).
Original project is MIT-licensed — see `ninja-game/LICENSE` and `CITATION.md` for attribution.

Run locally:

cd ninja-game
python3 main.py

Notes:
- Some games require a display (X11/SDL). See `Dockerfile` for a containerized runtime hint.
